# How to compile the source code

This game is written in C# so you need to have .NET installed.

The game uses Bridge.NET to transpile the C# code into javascript. Compile the code using `MSBuild`:

* `"MSBuild.exe" "./Source code/ChessCompStompWithHacks.sln"`

This will generate the transpiled javascript files in `Source code/ChessCompStompWithHacks/bin/Debug/bridge/`

We also need the font, image, and audio files:

* Copy the `Data` folder to `Source code/ChessCompStompWithHacks/bin/Debug/bridge/`

Then, to run the game, simply run `Source code/ChessCompStompWithHacks/bin/Debug/bridge/Chess Comp Stomp with Hacks.html` in a web browser.
